## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Modern CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned that I should only put my CSS in one place. I shouldn't put my CSS in both HTML and CSS files at the same time for consistency.

### AI Collaboration

I use Gemini to estimate the sizing of the spaces, font sizes, and border radius.
